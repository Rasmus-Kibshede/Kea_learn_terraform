# Defining and Retrieving Secrets

# WARNING: This won't work for Azure For Student accounts. 

1. Define the secret:

```hcl
resource "azurerm_key_vault_secret" "example" {
  name         = "example-secret"
  value        = "mySecretValue"
  key_vault_id = azurerm_key_vault.example.id
}
```

2. What is the key and what is the value?

<details> 
  <summary>Hint</summary>

    Key is `example-secret`.
    Value is `mySecretValue`.
</details>

3. Retrieve the secret by the same key:

```hcl
data "azurerm_key_vault_secret" "example" {
  name         = "example-secret"
  key_vault_id = azurerm_key_vault.example.id
}
```

4. [Optional] Outputting the value is not recommended but done for the sake of the example. 

```hcl
# Note: Exposing secrets in output is a security risk. This is for example purposes only.
output "secret_value" {
  value = data.azurerm_key_vault_secret.example.value
#   required otherwise, Terraform will not perform that action since it is aware that a secret is being exposed
  sensitive = true
}
```
