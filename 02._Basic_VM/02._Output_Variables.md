## Output and variables

1. Create a new folder here named `test_output` and add a `main.tf` file. 

2. Run `terraform init`. 

3. In `main.tf` add this:

```hcl
resource "random_string" "name" {
  length  = 8
  special = false
  upper   = false
}
```

What it does is generate a random string. This is useful for generating unique names automatically. 

4. Below it, add this:

```hcl
output "random_string" {
  value = random_string.name.result
}
```

This will output the string to the terminal once you apply. 

5. Run `terraform apply`.

Notice the output. 

6. Run `terraform apply` again. 

Notice that the output is the same. That's because it is stored in the state file: `terraform.tfstate`. Open the file and verify that it is there.

This is useful if you generate a random string and name your resource after it, then it will be stored for later use.
