## Solve Security Issue

In the previous assignment you played around with variables in Terraform in the subfolder `test_variables`. 

Now, solve it in this folder. 

1. Create the file `terraform.tfvars` in this folder. 

2. Generate a secret password and define it the file. 

<details> 
  <summary>Hint</summary>
    In the file: `terraform.tfvars`. Remember to change the password. 

```hcl
vm_name     = "exampleVM"
vm_username = "azureuser"
vm_password = "SecurePassword123!"
```
</details>


3. Define the types in `variables.tf`:

```hcl
variable "vm_name" {
  description = "The name of the virtual machine"
  type        = string
}

variable "vm_password" {
  description = "The admin password for the virtual machine"
  type        = string
  sensitive   = true
}
```

4. Get the password from the file and include it in `main.tf`. 

<details> 
  <summary>Hint</summary>
    In the file: `terraform.tfvars`

```hcl
resource "azurerm_linux_virtual_machine" "main" {
name                = var.vm_name
admin_password      = var.vm_password
}
```
</details>
