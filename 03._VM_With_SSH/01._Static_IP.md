## Static IP Adress

## 1. Study the difference between this `main.tf` and the one from the previous example:

The previous example:

```hcl
  ip_configuration {
    name                          = "internal"
    subnet_id                     = azurerm_subnet.main.id
    private_ip_address_allocation = "Dynamic"
  }
```

The current example:

```hcl
resource "azurerm_public_ip" "example" {
  name                = "example-publicip"
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  allocation_method   = "Static"
}
```

What do you think `static allocation` means in this context?

<details> 
  <summary>Hint</summary>
`allocation_method = "Static"` specifies that a fixed, unchanging IP address is manually assigned to a resource. In contrast, private_ip_address_allocation = "Dynamic" means the IP address is automatically assigned by the network from a pool of available addresses and can change over time, such as when the resource is restarted.
</details>



## 2. Generate an SSH key:

Notice this:

```public_key = file("~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub")```

You should have an ssh key in that location:

## Generating a SSH-key

Generate a 4096-bit RSA SSH-key pair. 

*nix (tldr ssh-keygen):

```bash
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "comment|email”
```

Windows (2048-bit RSA key is the default): 

```powershell
$ ssh-keygen -m PEM -t rsa -b 4096
```
