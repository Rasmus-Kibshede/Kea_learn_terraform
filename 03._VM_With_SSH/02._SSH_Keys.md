## SSH Keys

This Terraform project is step up from the last since it uses SSH keys rather than password for authentication. 

1. Find the SSH key definition in `main.tf`:

Notice this:

```public_key = file("~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub")```

You should have an ssh key in that location:

## [Optional] Generating a SSH-key

In case you don't already have one. 

Generate a 4096-bit RSA SSH-key pair. 

*nix (tldr ssh-keygen):

```bash
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "comment|email”
```

Windows (2048-bit RSA key is the default): 

```powershell
$ ssh-keygen -m PEM -t rsa -b 4096
```
