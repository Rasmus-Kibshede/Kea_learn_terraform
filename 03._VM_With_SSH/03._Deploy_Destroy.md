## 01. Deploy

Run:

```bash
$ terraform apply
```

## 02. Check that it works

SSH into the server. 

```bash
$ ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa adminuser@<ip_address>
```

`-i` means "identity file" and allows us to point to the private key for authentication. 

We have named the user adminuser in `main.tf`. If you change it, then change it in the ssh command accordingly. 

`ip_address`: Get it from the outputs. 

## 03. Destroy

Once you have succeeded in logging onto the server, tear down everything. 

```bash
$ terraform destroy
```
