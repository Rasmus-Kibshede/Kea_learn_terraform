## Init

1. Study the code in the link below.

Example Usage - HTTP Trigger with code upload:

https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs/resources/function_app_function#example-usage---http-trigger-with-code-upload

An HTTP Trigger means that the code executes when the URL is requested. 

2. We want to use Javascript instead of C#. 

Nothing wrong with C#, but let's try something new.

In this folder there is a `main.tf` with modifications for Javascript. 



4. Make sure that the storage account name is globally unique. 

It can be found here:

```hcl
resource "azurerm_storage_account" "example" {
  name                     = "todomustbegloballyunique"
  ...
}
```


5. Make sure that the Hostname is unique:

It can be found here:


```hcl
resource "azurerm_linux_function_app" "example" {
  name                = "todothismustalsobegloballyunique"
  ...
}
```
